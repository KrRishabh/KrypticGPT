Thanks for info. I was thinking the same thing, I keep seeing people posting about duolingo leveraging AI but I can never figure out what they exactly did in that regard.Sat, 31 Jan 2026 14:58:55 GMT
Can you point out exactly how Duolingo is using AI? I haven't seen any clear case proven usage by them yetFri, 30 Jan 2026 23:34:59 GMT
The recent chaos with #ClawdBot/#OpenClaw exactly showcases what the CEO of $PATH has been telling for months.
Their ability to bring agentic automation and orchestration in one trusted system, together with security, governance, and compliance, is the real differentiator.

Investors are now interested in seeing tech companies reduce employee costs and showcase that they can leverage AI for their operations.
Companies like $LMND are going to create a flywheel where others who can't follow along will get devalued & get labelled as unprepared for AI.Fri, 30 Jan 2026 08:19:42 GMT
The rise of so many AI automation products suddenly shows that it's the next big thing. Now we will have to find out if $Path can capture some of that market. Even a fraction of TAM is huge.
Since it's priced as if it's a dying company, the PE expansion can be insane.Fri, 30 Jan 2026 08:13:12 GMT

Why pay attention to digital marketing stocks:
As building apps/software products gets easier with AI, the game would be - who has better distribution?
The money saved through AI coding can be allocated to the marketing budget, creating a tailwind for digital marketing platforms.Mon, 26 Jan 2026 18:02:22 GMT

During this time of uncertainty in the stock, this demo might be a good watch to get reminded of the original investment thesis for $PATH:

When it comes to investments, the problem with social media is that creators only discuss what people want to hear. That's how TRP works. If someone goes against, nobody likes to listen. But for investments, this can be disastrous. You need neglected ideas to make good returns.Wed, 14 Jan 2026 20:00:47 GMT

You're correct RPA is legacy and that's why the stock is down. The stock is so down that if there's any growth from agentic orchestration then that should pump the stock upwards and that's exactly what our thesis is. Even capturing 10% of the market share of Ai automation is big.Wed, 14 Jan 2026 06:05:13 GMT
Looks like $PATH fell yesterday because the CEO sold shares and not because of the Claude Cowork launch.

Anyone who starts taking investing seriously will have to realize that you'll eventually have to play the game of - 'Go Big or Go Home', otherwise you're simply wasting your time getting index returns which you could have got without any effort anyway.Sun, 11 Jan 2026 18:24:53 GMT
I wonder how this will impact the stocks of those e-commerce platforms. Because it means that those websites will get less visitors and hence less opportunity for them to show ads and promote their own products.Fri, 09 Jan 2026 12:57:28 GMT
#COFORGE stock has fallen a lot because of the expensive acquisition of an AI company.
While the market is not factoring in that this also means that now AI contributes a larger fraction of COFORGE's revenue, which deserves a higher P/E.Fri, 09 Jan 2026 04:14:37 GMT
it's not a fixed target value, i just wanted to convey the idea. It could be $30 or $50 or anything, the idea is that the stock price would have run up quicklyThu, 08 Jan 2026 18:12:58 GMT
If $PATH shows revenue growth then the stock is immediately going to hit $40. That is why those who anticipate it's coming up need to have already bought it at $15.Thu, 08 Jan 2026 17:49:31 GMT

Looks like one of the downside is that UiPath doesn't have any visibility on how they are going to attract customers apart from who are already a client.
It's covered in this interview at 1:20

For those who still don't have fundamental understanding of how $PATH's RPA and Agentic Ai compliment each other. This interview is a must watch.
